Description: |
    Popt is a C library for parsing command line parameters. Popt was
    heavily influenced by the getopt() and getopt_long() functions, but
    it improves on them by allowing more powerful argument expansion.
    Popt can parse arbitrary argv[] style arrays and automatically set
    variables based on command line arguments. Popt allows command line
    arguments to be aliased via configuration files and includes utility
    functions for parsing arbitrary strings into argv[] arrays using
    shell-like rules.
